The artifact is structurally correct, but its loading-state rules still paint the full form and totals rectangles with 78% opaque warm backgrounds. That replaces the white card with a beige card rather than eliminating the rectangular wash.

```

## R5-E5-FIX2 exact operation

Start from `spatial-flow(31).css`.

Inside `Native Cart loading state`, replace only:

```css
background: rgba(246, 241, 235, .78) !important;
```

with:

```css
background: transparent !important;
```

and replace only:

```css
background: rgba(237, 231, 223, .78) !important;
```

with:

```css
background: transparent !important;
```

Do not alter `opacity: 1`, the overlay elements, loader, notice block or any other CSS.

## Remaining sequence

```text
R5-E5-FIX2 exact artifact validation
→ R5-E5 runtime loading / notice / Undo acceptance
→ R5-E6 final strict functional + visual acceptance
→ binary Cart status decision
